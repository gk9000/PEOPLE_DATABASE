This is a project that is presented in Terry Martin's "Professional Java Developer Career Starter: Java Foundations" course on Udemy. <br><br>
The project is creating a framework for performing CRUD operations on people objects. People may (but not must) have home and business addresses and children as separate objects.
As this is a study project, an embedded database (H2) is used.  <br><br>
Of course, the project was done by the teacher. I had to introduce some very minor changes as on my computer H2 database didn't want to behave exactly as on teacher's computer.  <br><br>
The fact that this project is presented here doesn't mean that I myself currently can create something like this. It only means that I kind of understand what is going on there :-).
